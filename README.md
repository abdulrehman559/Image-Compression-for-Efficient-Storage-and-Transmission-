Image compression project using JPEG and Wavelet techniques in Python.
It compares both methods and evaluates quality using PSNR, SSIM, and Compression Ratio.

Input image: OIP.png
Input path: C:/Users/DELL/Desktop/DSP assignment/OIP.png

Key Features:

JPEG compression with quality = 10

Wavelet compression using db1 and level = 3

PSNR, SSIM, and Compression Ratio calculations

Shows difference images

Saves compressed and difference images

Plots comparison graphs

Libraries Used:
opencv-python
numpy
PyWavelets
matplotlib
scikit-image

To install:
pip install opencv-python numpy pywt matplotlib scikit-image

Output:

Compressed images (JPEG and Wavelet)

Difference images

Graphs comparing size, PSNR, SSIM, Compression Ratio

Output folder: C:/Users/DELL/Desktop/DSP assignment/output_images

No extra setup needed. Just run the code and check output images and graphs.
